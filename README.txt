When assembling and linking an assembly program using NASM and LD, specific parameters are used to control the output format and compatibility. With NASM, the -f elf32 option tells the assembler to generate an object file in the 32-bit ELF (Executable and Linkable Format), which is standard for Linux systems. The source file, such as hello.asm, is passed directly to NASM, and the -o flag is used to specify the name of the output object file, like hello.o. This object file is then passed to the linker, LD, which combines it into an executable. The -m elf_i386 option in LD specifies that the target architecture is 32-bit x86 (i386), ensuring compatibility with the code assembled by NASM. Finally, the -o flag is again used to define the name of the final executable file, for example, hello. Together, these parameters ensure that the assembly source is properly assembled and linked into a functional 32-bit Linux executable.
